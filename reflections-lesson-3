When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  backup
  collaborate / share
  when you have different computers

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  	when somebody changes a file remotely it does not interfere with your own work
